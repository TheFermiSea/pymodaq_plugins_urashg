"""
Wavelength-Dependent RASHG Experiment for Spectroscopic Studies

This module implements spectroscopic μRASHG measurements with comprehensive
wavelength-dependent analysis. The experiment performs:

1. Wide wavelength range scans with fine spectral resolution
2. Wavelength-dependent anisotropy characterization
3. Spectral line shape analysis and fitting
4. Chromatic dispersion correction
5. Multi-order susceptibility analysis

The Wavelength-Dependent RASHG experiment is optimized for:
- Electronic resonance studies
- Bandgap characterization
- Dispersion relation mapping
- Multi-photon process identification
- Wavelength-optimized measurement protocols

This experiment extends the PDSHG framework with enhanced spectroscopic
capabilities and automated wavelength optimization routines.
