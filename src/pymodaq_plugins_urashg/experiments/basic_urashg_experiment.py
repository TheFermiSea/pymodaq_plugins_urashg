"""
Basic μRASHG Experiment with 4D Data Collection

This module implements the complete μRASHG experiment with full 4D data collection
including camera detection. This is the flagship experiment that combines:

1. Multi-dimensional parameter sweeps: [y, x, wavelength, angle]
2. Camera-based 2D detection with ROI support
3. Real-time EOM power control and rotator coordination
4. Background subtraction and image processing
5. Multi-threaded data acquisition and analysis

The Basic μRASHG experiment generates the complete dataset for:
- Spatial mapping of anisotropic responses
- Crystallographic orientation analysis
- Multi-wavelength spectroscopic studies
- Quantitative susceptibility tensor extraction

This experiment builds upon the PDSHG experiment by adding camera detection
and spatial mapping capabilities, making it suitable for full microscopy studies.
