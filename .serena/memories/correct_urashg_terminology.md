# Correct URASHG Terminology

## Important Correction
**URASHG** stands for "**micro Rotational Anisotropy Second Harmonic Generation**"
- The "u" represents the Greek letter μ (mu), meaning "micro"
- This is NOT "Ultrafast Reflection-mode Angle-resolved Second Harmonic Generation"

## Technical Details
- μRASHG (micro Rotational Anisotropy Second Harmonic Generation) is the correct full form
- In file names and code, "u" is used instead of "μ" to avoid Unicode issues
- The technique focuses on rotational anisotropy rather than angle-resolved measurements
- This is a microscopy technique for studying material properties through second harmonic generation

## Usage in Codebase
- Always use "micro Rotational Anisotropy Second Harmonic Generation" when spelling out the acronym
- Refer to the technique as "μRASHG" in documentation when possible
- Use "URASHG" in code/filenames due to Unicode limitations
- Maintain consistency across all documentation and code comments
