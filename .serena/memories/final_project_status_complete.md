# Final Project Status - URASHG PyMoDAQ Plugin Package

## Project Completion Status: âœ… COMPLETE

**Date**: August 2025  
**Status**: All objectives achieved, production ready

## Hardware Testing Results - ALL WORKING

**5/5 Core Devices Confirmed Functional with Real Hardware:**

1. **ESP300 Motion Controller**: `/dev/ttyUSB3` at 19200 baud - WORKING
2. **Elliptec Rotation Mounts**: `/dev/ttyUSB1` at 9600 baud - WORKING  
3. **Newport 1830-C Power Meter**: `/dev/ttyS0` at 9600 baud - WORKING
4. **Photometrics PrimeBSI Camera**: PyVCAM interface - WORKING
5. **MaiTai Laser**: `/dev/ttyUSB2` at 9600 baud with SCPI protocol - WORKING

## Key Technical Achievements

**Hardware Detection System**: Implemented device_scanner.py that automatically detects devices on correct ports instead of using hardcoded assumptions.

**PyMoDAQ 5.x Compliance**: All plugins fully compliant and functional with PyMoDAQ 5.x framework.

**Critical Communication Protocols Implemented**:
- MaiTai: SCPI protocol with XON/XOFF flow control
- Elliptec: Fixed ASCII decoding errors with proper binary handling  
- Newport: Added missing controller methods
- ESP300: Standard serial with proper identification

## Production Readiness

The URASHG plugin package is ready for scientific use with all devices confirmed working through real hardware testing. The systematic approach eliminated all assumptions and ensured proper communication with actual laboratory instruments.

## Repository Status

Clean and organized with all legacy files moved to appropriate directories, comprehensive documentation, and proper version control.
