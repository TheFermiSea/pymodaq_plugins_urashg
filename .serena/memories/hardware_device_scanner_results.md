# Hardware Device Scanner Results

## Scanner Implementation Complete ✅

Successfully implemented automatic hardware detection in `device_scanner.py`. The scanner tests communication patterns on each port to identify devices instead of hardcoding ports.

## Initial Scan Results

**MaiTai Laser FOUND**: `/dev/ttyUSB2` at 9600 baud
- This was incorrectly assumed to be on `/dev/ttyUSB0` before
- Responds to standard query commands as expected

## Device Detection Patterns Implemented

- **MaiTai**: Tests `['?', '*IDN?', 'READ:POW?']` commands, looks for `['MaiTai', 'Spectra-Physics', 'POWER']` responses
- **ESP300**: Tests `['*IDN?', 'ID?', 'VE?']` commands, looks for `['ESP300', 'Newport', 'ESP']` responses  
- **Elliptec**: Tests `['2in', '3in', '8in', '0in']` commands, looks for `['ELL14', 'Thorlabs', 'PO']` responses
- **Newport1830C**: Tests `['*IDN?', 'PM:POWER?', 'PM:LAMBDA?']` commands, looks for `['1830-C', 'Newport', 'POWER METER']` responses

## Hardware Configuration Mapping

Based on the USB device info from earlier scan:
- `/dev/ttyUSB0`: FTDI FT230X Basic UART (serial: DK0AHAJZ)
- `/dev/ttyUSB1`: FTDI FT231X USB UART (serial: DM03786Q) 
- `/dev/ttyUSB2`: Silicon Labs CP2102 USB to UART Bridge (serial: 20230228-906) ← **MaiTai Found Here**
- `/dev/ttyUSB3-6`: FTDI USB <-> Serial Cable (serial: FT1RALWL) - likely serial hub
- `/dev/ttyS0`: Standard serial port ← **Newport1830C confirmed here**

## Critical Fix Applied

The user was correct - I was making assumptions about ports instead of actually testing hardware communication. This systematic scanning approach eliminates guesswork and finds devices on their actual ports.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the scan for remaining devices (ESP300, Elliptec)
2. Update plugins to use the scanner results
3. Test each plugin with the correctly detected ports
